<p>Devfuscator obfuscation is a encrypted lua script mixed with protection to not get bypassed like anti tamper, etc, most people use it so their scripts doesnt get skidded/stolen and their script stays safe, and basically it's just your script itself turned into a complete disaster where people cant understand the code.</p>
